# Smooth

My interpretation of a comfortable color pallet to use with Hyper. This work is based on the work from the guys at [Ros√© Pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/hyper) and [ng-hai](https://github.com/ng-hai/hyper-rose-pine-next) that provided a clear example of how a responsive theme can be based on the macOS color scheme.

### Usage

```

or

```

  plugins: ["hyper-smooth"],
}
```
